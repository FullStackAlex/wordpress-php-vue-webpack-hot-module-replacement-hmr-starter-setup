Webpack config file to enable Webpack's Hot Module Replacement inside PHP files!!!

I have created the these empty files and directories only for a better visualisation of the webpack config settings values:
- src/main.js
- wordpress/wp-content/themes/your-fancy-theme/app/app.bundle.js 

There is no need for editing any Apache/Nginx config files, except you want to have custom dev.hostname for your local dev environment instead of for example "localhost:8015"

By the end of May 2019 there should be a Vue WordPress Starter Theme available on my GitHub account. It will have working SEO system without SSR!!! So you can then just drop in the theme into any existing WordPress site and get it working out of the box regardless your hosting conditions (whether node.js is available or not)!
